# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The idea for creating this GitHub Portfolio is to... - ok, I'm not going to make you fool, the main idea is to showcase my profile, but also... - put in codes some skills I've worked on, recreate some projects with other tech stacks, try to reproduce real-cases scenarios for subjects in the web and to share some knowledge (I love that!). Finally, I think I'll start to create a public space in this repo where I can share some great things I've solved in my days.


> *... Maybe one day I'll make a special and dedicated blog and a portfolio, but first things first, I will accomplish this mission in this repo to save time.*

# About Me
I can describe myself as someone who loves technology. But in particular, everything involving data can catch my eye easily. The way that it moves and how you can get the best of it is something that I feel is magical. I've worked with a large volume of data through manipulations, integrations, and analysis in the past years through university programs, projects in the industry (especially in the digital marketing industry), and some freelancers. Throughout these experiences, I've been exposed mainly to Python and Google Cloud Technologies. So most of the content you'll see here will probably have this bias.
